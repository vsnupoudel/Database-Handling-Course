"full minus PH",Ortophosphate,1,""Zero" the meter (if you are using one) using a reagent blank (distilled water plus the reagent powder) and following the manufacturer's directions."
"full minus PH","Total suspended solids",2,"TSS of a water or wastewater sample is determined by pouring a carefully measured volume of water (typically one litre; but less if the particulate density is high, or as much as two or three litres for very clean water) through a pre-weighed filter of a specified pore size, then weighing the filter again after the drying process that removes all water on the filter. Filters for TSS measurements are typically composed of glass fibres.[2] The gain in weight is a dry weight measure of the particulates present in the water sample expressed in units derived or calculated from the volume of water filtered (typically milligrams per litre or mg/L)."

"Full tests",PH,4,"The pH value can be measured using electrochemical measuring systems, litmus paper, or indicators and colorimeters. The easiest way to take a pH measurement is to use litmus paper or a colorimeter. The advantage of this type of pH measurement is that the pH range is well known and they are easy to apply."
